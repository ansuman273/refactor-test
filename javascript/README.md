# Refactor Imrovements

1. Added JsDoc for author comments and documentation which enhances the overall readability and makes it easy maintainable code.

2. Made use of standard camelCase format for all the variable and function names to adhere the JavaScript best practices for naming convention. Results indicate that camel casing leads to higher accuracy among all subjects regardless of training, and those trained in camel casing are able to recognize identifiers in the camel case style faster than identifiers in the underscore style.
